  - Use supported formats: PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT
  - Keep files under 50MB
  - For batch uploads, ensure ZIP contains only supported formats

#### **3. Analysis Failures**
- **Problem**: "Could not extract text" or "Analysis failed"
- **Solution**:
  - Check internet connection for API calls
  - Ensure job description is complete and detailed
  - Verify resume files contain extractable text (not just images)

#### **4. Batch Scoring Issues**
- **Problem**: All resumes getting identical scores
- **Solution**: 
  - The system now automatically detects batch analysis
  - Uses specialized prompts for varied scoring
  - Check console logs for "BATCH" mode confirmation

#### **5. Skills Analysis Errors**
- **Problem**: "Could not parse response" in skills section
- **Solution**:
  - The system now has robust JSON parsing
  - Automatically extracts skills even with extra text
  - Check console for detailed error logs

### **Error Messages & Meanings**

| Error Message | Meaning | Solution |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| "No valid resumes found" | No supported files in upload | Check file formats and content |
| "Could not extract text" | Resume is image-based or corrupted | Use text-based resumes |
| "Invalid file type" | Unsupported file format | Use PDF, DOCX, DOC, or TXT |
| "API key required" | Missing OpenAI API key | Enter valid API key |
| "File too large" | Exceeds 50MB limit | Compress or split files |

### **Common Questions**

**Q: Why are all my batch resumes getting the same score?**
A: The system now automatically detects batch analysis and uses specialized prompts for varied scoring. Check console logs for "BATCH" mode confirmation.

**Q: How do I use Postman with this API?**
A: See the detailed Postman setup guide in the "API Endpoints & Postman Usage" section above.

**Q: Can I analyze resumes without the web interface?**
A: Yes! Use the `/analyze` endpoint directly with Postman, curl, or any HTTP client.

**Q: How do I get different scores for different candidates?**
A: The system automatically handles this. For batch analysis, it uses higher temperature and specialized prompts to ensure varied scoring.
